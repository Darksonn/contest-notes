\section{Data structures}
\subsection{Fenwick tree}
Sum of a range. Both operations are \(O(\log n)\).
\code{data-structures/fenwick.java}
\subsection{Segment tree}
Update any value and perform interval queries.
\code{data-structures/segment-tree.java}
\subsection{Union find}
Also known as disjoint set.
\code{data-structures/union-find.java}
\subsection{Minimal spanning tree}
Returns a spanning forest in the given set with minimal weight.
\code{graph/kruskal.java}

\section{Number theory}
\subsection{Euclid}
Computes \(x\), \(y\) and \(d\) such that \(xa + yb = d = \operatorname{gcd}(a,b)\). \\
Note that you can find \texttt{lcm} using \(\operatorname{lcm}(a,b) = \frac{a \cdot
b}{\operatorname{gcd}(a,b)}\).
\code{number-theory/euclid.java}
\subsection{Modular inverse}
Assumes that \(a\) and \(mod\) are relatively prime.
\code{number-theory/mod-inverse.java}
\subsection{Modular power}
Computes \texttt{a\textsuperscript e \% mod}.
\code{number-theory/mod-pow.java}
\subsection{Chinese remainder theorem}
The \texttt{crt2} function finds \(x\) with \(x \equiv a \mod m\) and \(x \equiv b \mod
n\), while the \texttt{crt} function combines it to solve it for any number of equations.
Returns \texttt{true} if it found a solution.
\code{number-theory/crt.java}
\subsection{Prime sieve}
Compute all primes up to some number. Runs in \(O(n \log n \log \log n)\).
\code{number-theory/sieve.java}
\subsection{Binomial coefficients}
Compute the binomial coefficients.
\code{number-theory/binom.java}
\subsection{Catalan numbers}
Compute the \(n\) first Catalan numbers. These can be used for various things:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Number of expressions containing \(n\) pairs of parentheses which are correctly
    matched.
  \item Number of full binary trees with \(n+1\) leaves.
  \item Number of lattice paths in \(n \times n\) square that stay below the diagonal.
  \item A convex polygon with \(n+2\) sides can be cut into \(n\) triangles in \(C_n\)
    ways.
  \item Number of permutations with no three-term increasing subsequence.
\end{enumerate}
This uses the recursive formula \(C_0 = 1\) and \(C_{n+1} = \frac{2(2n+1)}{n+2} C_n\).
Could also use \(C_n = \frac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n} = \binom{2n}{n} - \binom{2n}{n+1}\).
\code{number-theory/catalan.java}

\section{Graph algorithms}
\subsection{Shortest path, negative loops}
A variant of Bellman Ford that computes shortest path. Marks unreachable nodes with
\verb|MAX_VALUE| and nodes reachable from a negative loop with \verb|MIN_VALUE|.
If there are no negative weight
\code{graph/shortest-path.java}
\subsection{Shortest path, no negative loops}
A simpler version of Bellman Ford that never terminates when given a negative loop.
\code{graph/shortest-path-noloop.java}
\subsection{Floyd Warshall}
Shortest path between all pairs of verticies. Negative weights are allowed. Runs in
\(O(n^3)\).
\code{graph/floyd-warshall.java}
\subsection{Maximum flow}
Computes the maximum flow in a graph.
\code{graph/max-flow.java}
\subsection{Minimum cut}
After running max-flow, the left side of a min-cut from the source to the sink is given
by all vertices reachable from the source, only traversing edges with positive residual
capacity.
\subsection{Minimum cost maximum flow}
Computes the minimum cost maximum flow in a graph using the successive shortest path
algorithm.
\code{graph/min-cost-max-flow.java}

\section{Matching}
A matching in a bipartite graph is a set of edges such that no edge share an endpoint.
You can find the largest possible matching using max-flow.
\subsection{Hall's marriage theorem}
Given a bipartite graph with nodes in \(X\) and \(Y\), the graph has a maximal matching
if and only if \(|N(S)| \geq |S|\) for any subset \(S \subseteq X\). Here \(N(S)\)
denotes the set of nodes in \(Y\) next to a node in \(S\).
\subsection{Blossom algorithm}
The blossoms algorithm can find a maximum matching in an arbitrary graph. An exposed
vertex is a vertex, which isn't the endpoint of any marked edge. A blossom is an
\(2k+1\) length cycle with \(k\) marked edges such that one of the verticies has an even
length alternating path (the stem) to an exposed vertex.

The basic algorithm is to find a path between two exposed verticies and augmenting the
path by swapping the matching along the path. If no such path exists, then the matching
is optimal.

\section{Linear algebra}
\subsection{Solve linear equations}
Find any solution of \(Ax = b\) in \(O(n^2m)\) time. Returns rank of solution, or \(-1\)
if no solution is found. Data in \texttt{A} and \texttt{b} is lost.
\code{linear-algebra/linear-system.java}
\subsection{Partial linear equations}
To get all uniquely determined values back, make the following changes. Non-unique values
are left as NaN.
\code{linear-algebra/partial-linear-system.java}

\section{Geometry}
\subsection{Triangles}
Given side lengths \(a, b, c\):
\begin{description}
  \item[Semiperimeter] \(p = \tfrac{1}{2} (a+b+c)\).
  \item[Area] \(A = \sqrt{p (p-a)(p-b)(p-c)}\).
  \item[Circumradius] \(R = \dfrac{abc}{4A}\).
  \item[Inradius] \(r = A / p\).
  \item[Law of sines]
    \(\dfrac{\sin \alpha}a = \dfrac{\sin \beta}b = \dfrac{\sin \gamma}c = \dfrac1{2R}\).
  \item[Law of cosines] \(a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos\alpha\).
\end{description}

\subsection{2D point class}
Various utility functions for computational geometry.
\code{geometry/geometry.java}

\subsection{Convex hull}
Computes the convex hull in counter clockwise order in \(O(n \log n)\) time.
Use \verb|>=| instead of \verb|<=| to get clockwise order.
\code{geometry/convex-hull.java}
\subsection{Closest pair}
Find the closest pair of points in \(O(n (\log n)^2)\) time.
\code{geometry/closest-pair.java}
\subsection{Polygon area}
Finds the area of a polygon using the shoelace formula. Returns twice the signed area,
which is negative if points are in clockwise order.
\code{geometry/polygon-area.java}
